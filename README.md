# MDE-Project 2021
 Project Work done by-
  Mariia Smirnova
        and
  Himanshu Pandey
  
 The Repository consists of different task assigned during The MDE course at Univaq, for se4gd masters course.
  Task1- Implimentation of a domain language for Managing a smart farm details Using **MPS**
  1) The model has following Concepts-
     Farm, Drone, Camera, Sensor, Water(sensor), Soil(sensor), Temperature(sensor),Light, Crop,AI, Crate
  2) Enum data type-
     LightType, AItype
  3) Constrained DataType
      Crateid
  This project has 2 main root elements Farm and the Crates contained by it.
  Farm is a single entity linked to multiple Crates.
  
  Task2- A encore model with ocl constrains, operation and derived fields for the domain smart farm.
     *)Here we have a root class Farm.
     *)Each farm contains Crates, AI, Camera and Drones.
     *)Each crate has information about the camera, drone, ai which are derived using ocl.
     *)Each crate also contain a crop and a light for giving energy to the crop and the related sensors for monitoring the crate.
     *)We have used multiple emfatic and ocl concepts in this projects like enum data type,
     constraints and query operations over values of different sensors.
