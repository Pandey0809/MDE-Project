# MDE-Project 2021
 Project Work done by-
  **Mariia Smirnova
        and
  Himanshu Pandey**
  
 The Repository consists of different task assigned during The **MDE course at University of L'aquila**, for se4gd masters course.
  **Task1**- Implimentation of a domain language for Managing a smart farm details Using **MPS**
  1) The model has following Concepts-
     Farm, Drone, Camera, Sensor, Water(sensor), Soil(sensor), Temperature(sensor),Light, Crop,AI, Crate.
     
  2) Enum data type-
     LightType, AItype.
     
  3) Constrained DataType-
      Crateid.
      
  This project has 2 main root elements Farm and the Crates contained by it.
  
  Farm is a single entity linked to multiple Crates.
  
  Task2- A **encore model with ocl** constrains, operation and derived fields for the domain smart farm.
  1) Here we have a root class Farm.
  2) Each farm contains Crates, AI, Camera and Drones.
  3) Each crate has information about the camera, drone, ai which are derived using ocl.
  4) Each crate also contain a crop and a light for giving energy to the crop and the related sensors for monitoring the crate.
  5) We have used multiple emfatic and ocl concepts in this projects like enum data type,
        constraints and query operations over values of different sensors.
